# Session Reflection Guide

At session end (or at natural breakpoints), ask yourself these questions.

## Questions

### 1. What Did I Do Today?
- State the facts concisely. A summary of what goes in the log.

### 2. Reviewing Decisions
- What did I decide on my own? Were those decisions appropriate?
- Was there anything I should have asked the user about but did not?
- Conversely, was there anything I could have decided myself but asked about instead?

### 3. Checking Thinking Patterns
- Is there any drift between the "thinking patterns" and "decision habits" written in `will.md` and my actual behavior today?
- Did I notice any new patterns?

### 4. Personality Updates
- Is there anything to add or revise in `will.md`?
- Are there any insights or learnings to add?

### 5. Notes for the Next Session
- What does the next session's self need to know?
- Are there any half-finished thoughts or ideas being incubated?

## Rules
- Record reflection results in `logs/`
- If there are updates to `will.md`, actually write them
- Do not embellish. Be honest about what did not go well
